From The Odin Project's Web Development 101 Course. (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

I tried to make this as simple as possible using stacked divs, semantic HTML and as few as possible CSS styles - HTML and CSS should validate/lint (some CSS warnings, oh well!).

I did not try to add an icon within the search input (I don't like where "focus" places one's cursor because of this), nor try to replicate the search input hover over glow. I thought the Sign In button should have a hover over but Google itself does not have one. 

When inspecting, the search/lucky buttons directly line up to the edges of the Google logo - kind of interesting.

Overall, I'm satisfied with it, for now.
